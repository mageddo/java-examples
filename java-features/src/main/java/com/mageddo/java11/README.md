# Java 11 Features
In this example I cover the new Java features which I consider relevant,
 commonly the ones related to code style, I don't have the habit to cover preview features. 

* [JEP 323: Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters][2]
* [JEP 321: HTTP Client (Standard)][3]
    * [Http Client Doc][4]
    * [Examples][5]
* [JEP 328: Flight Recorder][6]
